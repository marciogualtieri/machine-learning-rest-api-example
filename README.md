# Example REST API + Machine Learning Using Flask and Scikit-learn

The purpose of this notebook is to serve as an example of creating a machine learning model (regression with random forest built with [`sklearn`](https://scikit-learn.org/)) and using it in a REST API.

We are using [`Flask`](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) to create the REST API, but it could be integrated to other frameworks, such as Django, Pyramid, etc.

Everything is self-contained inside a single Jupyter notebook.

You will find the original notebook [here](./jupyter/Model.ipynb). You will also find the rendered notebook [here](https://marciogualtieri.github.io/machine-learning-rest-api-example/jupyter/Model.html).
